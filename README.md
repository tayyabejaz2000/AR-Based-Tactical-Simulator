## Augmented Reality based Tactical Simulator

Augmented Reality based tactical training simulator for special forces.

- The simulation includes a team of multiple members in various scenarios.

- Team members will communicate with each other using call outs, tagging in 3d space, and can view the location of their allies.

- Each member is part of the virtual arena connected to a single lobby. A lobby can also have observers analysing the performance of players.

- A player can see a 3D or 2D view of the arena through their device. AR mesh generation will enable team members to share their 3D views.

- The simulator will cover different types of scenarios like rescue operations and arena sweep.

- Post-training analysis will be provided through the app where the performance of each player can be analysed and their responses to callouts can be judged.
